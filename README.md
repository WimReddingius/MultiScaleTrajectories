# How to use

## Configuration

In the top-right corner, you can select which algorithm type you wish to run. For each of these algorithm types, it is possible to have differents kinds of implementations, but they all accept the same kind of input.

 Each of these algorithm types can be instantiated to create a configuration for that specific type. New configurations can be added, and configurations can be saved to/loaded from disk. This is useful for restoring an experimental setup, as well as (re-)investigating the output/statistics of the run experiments themselves.
 
 Each configuration consists of the following:

 - Algorithm library: a set of configurations for specific implementations of the algorithm type
 - Input library: a set of inputs which can be used to run these algorithms. Inputs can be saved to/loaded from disk or imported using a custom importer. Furthermore, differents kinds of custom input editors may be defined for visualizing and editing the input.
 - Workload: a set of outputs and statistics produced by running one or more algorithm run configurations. An algorithm run configuration consists of the following:
   - A specific input chosen from the input library.
   - A specific implementation configuration chosen from the algorithm library
   - An amount of iterations for which to repeat running the given algorithm on the given input. This is useful for gathering samples.
 
   Run configurations can be executed by selecting one or multiple of them (indicated in blue) and clicking `Compute`. Note that you can select multiple configurations uing CTRL+CLICK or SHIFT+CLICK on the run configuration name, akin to selecting files/folder in the Windows file explorer. Running multiple configurations at the same time will execute each run configuration in a separate thread. Using the same way of selecting multiple run configurations, it is also possible to clear the output of multiple run configurations at the same time by clicking the `Reset` button. Based on the color of the `Amount` column, you can tell what the status of a run configuration is. It is either idle (red), running (yellow), or green (finished all iterations).

   As alluded to earlier, when the algorithm type configuration is stored to disk, the algorithm workload configuration as well as any produced workload output/statistics is persisted.

## Output Visualization

In the main panel on the left, visualizations can be shown for the output of the run configurations. This can either by the output of the algorithm or (live) statistics that were gathered. The type of visualization can be chosen by hovering your mouse over the top edge and selecting the type of visualization in the dropdown menu on the left. 

By default, the run configurations that are visualized inside of a visualization are chosen automatically, but you can disable this by clicking the `Choose` button and selecting one or more (using CTRL+CLICK or SHIFT+CLICK) configurations. You can go back to automatically selecting the run configurations shown by a visualization by clicking the `Auto` button.

Finally, by clicking the `Split` button, it is possible to show multiple visualizations at the same time by splitting the visualization panel either vertically or horizontally. This can be do as often as you want to create many different simultaneous visualizations. Alternatively, by selecting the `Unsplit` option, a visualization will be removed and the neighboring visualization will be expanded to fill the space.

The following pre-defined visualizations are available for any kind of algorithm:

- Statistics: run statistics such as running time and iterations completed, algorithm configuration, input statistics, and output statistics
- Log: raw logging generated by the algorithm
 
## Progressive simplification plugins

To understand the problem solved by the algorithms described below, as well as additional context for the chosen visualizations, refer to [my thesis](https://iverb.me/research/thesis.pdf).

### Algorithm types

All algorithms use the Hausdorff distance as error measure.

- Single Trajectory Multi-Scale Simplification: the progressive simplification problem.
- Shortcut finding - Multi Scale: finding all shortcuts given a set of errors.
- Shortcut path finding: finding the shortest path in a shortcut graph.
